# Clean Code

This repository holds the code examples and snapshots as well as any other resources belonging to our ["Clean Code" course](https://acad.link/clean-code) and this project will be written in Python entirely.

# How To Use

This repository comes with many branches - different branches reflect different attachments. In the course, links to the appropriate branches are added directly to the course lectures.
